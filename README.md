### what is ReduceMemory & ReduceDisk ?
- [ReduceMemory](https://www.sordum.org/9197/reduce-memory-v1-4/) is a magical software will reduce your memory usage in one click, and you can make it reduce the memory automatically too,
- [ReduceDisk](https://github.com/REVENGE977/debloat-win10/raw/main/somethings/ReduceDisk.exe) is a software created by me, i realized that on the newer windows updates when you end 'System' task from the task manager
the disk usage will be reduced, so this will actually end 'System' task all the time to reduce the disk usage,
i know this may be weird but i tried it and it actually works so try it by yourself !
