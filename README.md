- [ReduceDisk](https://github.com/REVENGE977/debloat-win10/raw/main/somethings/ReduceDisk.exe)
 is a software created by me, i realized that on the newer windows updates when you end 'System' task from the task manager
the disk usage will be reduced, so this will actually end 'System' task all the time to reduce the disk usage,
i know this is so weird but i tried it and it actually works so try it by yourself !

**chocolatey is required to install both**
